A interactive flashcard web application to help users memorize specific bible passages and their verse reference.  You can create your own collections of cards for better organization.  Users can mark cards as memorized and keep track of which cards are memorized.  The user's total score is stored in the database and displayed next to their name in the header.

### Problem
I often an't remember where certain passages are located in the Bible.  I wanted to remember where in the bible specific passages are located.  This also can be extrapolated to any thing else you want to put on a flash card and create new decks!

### Future Work
* Connect to an external Bible API to import verse when creating new cards

### Technologies
* HTML/CSS
* Bootstrap - CSS Framework
* axios - AJAX requests
* Express.js
* Node.js
* Knex.js
* PostgreSQL
